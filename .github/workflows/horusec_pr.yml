      #we need to ignore sample, automatedTests, automated-tests and .gradle because they are not being shipped the Beagle sdk
      #The two hash was added because we have False Positive on TextInput.swift, we have an enum called PASSWORD, and UrlBuilderDefault.kt, we have a base64 failure but we don't use the base64 on this code
