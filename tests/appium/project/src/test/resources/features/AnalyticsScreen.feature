Feature: Analytics validation
  As a Beagle developer/user
  I'd like to make sure my Analytics works as expected
  In order to guarantee that my application never fails

  Background:
    Given the Beagle application did launch with the Analytics screen url

  Scenario: Analytics 01 - Action with no remote analytics config and not declared in the local config (should not create record)
    When I click on text Alert with no specific analytics configuration
    Then a dialog should appear on the screen with text AlertMessage
    When I click on text OK
    Then no analytics record should be created

  Scenario: Analytics 02 - Action with no remote analytics config and declared in the local config (should create record with params in config)
    When I click on text Confirm with analytics local configuration
    Then a dialog should appear on the screen with text Confirm Message
    When I click on text ACCEPT
    Then an analytics record should be created for Analytics 02

  Scenario: Analytics 03 - Action with remote analytics config and not declared in the local config (should create record with params from remote config)
    When I click on text Alert with remote analytics configuration
    Then a dialog should appear on the screen with text AlertMessage
    When I click on text OK
    Then an analytics record should be created for Analytics 03

  Scenario: Analytics 04 - Action with analytics disabled in the remote config (should not create record)
    When I click on text Confirm with disabled analytics configuration
    Then a dialog should appear on the screen with text Confirm Message
    When I click on text ACCEPT
    Then no analytics record should be created

  Scenario: Analytics 05 - View loaded, screen analytics enabled in the config (should create record)
    When I click on text navigateToPage
    When I click on text navigate to local screen
    Then an analytics record should be created for Analytics 05
