Feature: ListView Component Validation

  As a Beagle developer/user
  I'd like to make sure my listView component works as expected
  In order to guarantee that my application never fails

  Background:
    Given that I'm on the listView screen
        
    # --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
    # ListView charactersList: horizontal with pagination and custom iteratorName    
    # --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  Scenario: ListView 01 - Characters ListView on pagination 1
#    When I read all the elements of the listView with id charactersList on pagination 1
#    Then the listView with id charactersList on pagination 1 should have exactly 34 items
#    And  the screen should show text: status: read
#    And  the screen should show text: 1/2
#    And  the values of the listView with id charactersList on pagination 1 should be:
