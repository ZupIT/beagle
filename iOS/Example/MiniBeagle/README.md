## MiniBeagle

This project contains a simple and tiny implementation of some important things for Beagle. And thus, it can be used as a workbench for developers to try out new ideas without having to actually change a lot of Beagle code. It maybe could be a good "documentation" for new developers that want to understand some of Beagle's internals.
