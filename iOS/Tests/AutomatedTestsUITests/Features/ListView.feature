#Feature: ListView Component Validation
#
#    As a Beagle developer/user
#    I'd like to make sure my listView component works as expected
#    In order to guarantee that my application never fails
#
#
#    Scenario: ListView 01 - listView component renders text attribute correctly
#        Given the app did load listview screen
#        Then listview screen should render all text attributes correctly
#
#    Scenario: ListView 02 - listView component performs vertical scroll correctly
#        Given the app did load listview screen
#        When I have a vertical list configured
#        Then listview screen should perform the scroll action vertically
#
#    Scenario: ListView 03 - listView component performs horizontal scroll correctly
#        When I have a horizontal list configured
#        Then listview screen should perform the scroll action horizontally
