Feature: TextInput Validation

    As a Beagle developer/user
    I'd like to make sure my textInput works as expected

    Background:
        Given the Beagle application did launch with the textInput on screen

    Scenario Outline: TextInput 01 - validate value field if filled
        Then I must check if the textInput value "<textInputValue>" appears on the screen

        Examples:
            | textInputValue            |
            | TextInput test            |
            | TextInput with expression |

    Scenario Outline: TextInput 02 - validate placeholder field if filled
        Then I must check if the textInput placeholder "<textInputPlaceholder>" appears on the screen

        Examples:
            | textInputPlaceholder                  |
            | TextInput placeholder                 |
            | TextInput placeholder with expression |
    
    Scenario Outline: TextInput 03 - validate disabled field
        Then verify if the field with the placeholder "<textInputDisabled>" is disabled

        Examples:
            | textInputDisabled                                 |
            | Standard text with disabled field                 |
            | Standard text with disabled field with expression |
            
    Scenario Outline: TextInput 04 - validate readOnly field
        Then verify if the field with the value "<textInputReadOnly>" is read only

        Examples:
            | textInputReadOnly            |
            | is Read Only                 |
            | is Read Only with expression |

    Scenario Outline: TextInput 05 - validate keyboard appears on Focus
        When I click in the textInput with the placeholder "<textInputSecondPlan>"
        Then verify if the textInput "<textInputSecondPlan>" is the first responder

        Examples:
            | textInputSecondPlan                           |
            | is a textInput in second plan                 |
            | is a textInput in second plan with expression |
            
    Scenario Outline: TextInput 06 - validate textInput of type number
        When I click in the textInput with the placeholder "<textInputTypeNumber>"
        Then validate textInput component of type number with text "<textInputTypeNumber>"

        Examples:
            | textInputTypeNumber                      |
            | is textInput type number                 |
            | is textInput type number with expression |
    
    Scenario Outline: TextInput 07 - validate textInput with actions of onChange, onFocus and onBlur
        When I click in the textInput with the placeholder "<placeholder>"
        Then change to "<didOnFocus>" then to "<didOnChange>" then to "<didOnBlur>"

        Examples:
            | placeholder       | didOnFocus | didOnChange | didOnBlur |
            | action validation | DidOnFocus | DidOnChange | DidOnBlur |
    
    Scenario Outline: TextInput 08 - validate textInput with actions of onChange, onFocus and onBlur
        When I click in the textInput with the placeholder "<placeholder>"
        Then change to "<didOnFocus>" then to "<didOnChange>" then to "<didOnBlur>" in the correct order

        Examples:
            | placeholder  | didOnFocus | didOnChange           | didOnBlur                      |
            | action order | DidOnFocus | DidOnFocusDidOnChange | DidOnFocusDidOnChangeDidOnBlur |
    
    Scenario Outline: TextInput 09 - validate that textInput is hidden
        Then The hidden input fields "<textInputHidden>" should not be visible

        Examples:
            | textInputHidden                     |
            | this text is hidden                 |
            | this text is hidden with expression |
