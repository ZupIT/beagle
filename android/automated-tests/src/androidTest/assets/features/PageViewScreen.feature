#Feature: PageView Component Validation
#
#    As a Beagle developer/user
#    I'd like to make sure my pageView component works as expected
#    In order to guarantee that my application never fails
#
#    Background:
#        Given that I'm on the pageview screen
#
#    Scenario: PageView 01 - PageView component renders text attribute correctly
#        Then my pageview components should render their respective pages attributes correctly
