Feature: ListView Component Validation

    As a Beagle developer/user
    I'd like to make sure my listView component works as expected
    In order to guarantee that my application never fails

    Background:
        Given that I'm on the listView screen
#        And the view port size is 720x480

  # First ListView: characters: horizontal with pagination and custom iteratorName

    Scenario: ListView 01 - Characters ListView
        Then should render the list of characters with exactly 34 items in the horizontal plane
        And the list of characters should be scrollable only horizontally
        And the page number should be 1/2

    Scenario: ListView 02 - Characters ListView: going from page 1 to 2
        When I click the button next
        Then should render the list of characters with exactly 33 items in the horizontal plane
        And the page number should be 2/2

    Scenario: ListView 03 - Characters ListView: going back from page 2 to 1
        When I click the button next
        And I click the button prev
        Then should render the list of characters with exactly 34 items in the horizontal plane
        And the page number should be 1/2

    Scenario Outline: ListView 04 - Characters ListView: page 1 item by item
        Then should render character <name> of <book> in <collection> at <position> in the list of characters
#        And the book analytics should have been called with character "<name>" and source "characters-list"

        Examples:
            | position | name                    | book                                     | collection             |
