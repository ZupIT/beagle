Feature: ListView Component Validation

    As a Beagle developer/user
    I'd like to make sure my listView component works as expected
    In order to guarantee that my application never fails

    Background:
        Given that I'm on the listView screen
#        And the view port size is 720x480

  # First ListView: characters: horizontal with pagination and custom iteratorName

    Scenario: ListView 01 - Characters ListView
        Then should render the list of characters with exactly 34 items in the horizontal plane
        And the list of characters should be scrollable only horizontally
        And the page number should be 1/2

    Scenario: ListView 02 - Characters ListView: going from page 1 to 2
        When I click the button next
        Then should render the list of characters with exactly 33 items in the horizontal plane
        And the page number should be 2/2

    Scenario: ListView 03 - Characters ListView: going back from page 2 to 1
        When I click the button next
        And I click the button prev
        Then should render the list of characters with exactly 34 items in the horizontal plane
        And the page number should be 1/2

    Scenario Outline: ListView 04 - Characters ListView: page 1 item by item
        Then should render character <name> in <book> in <collection> at <position> in the list of characters
#        And the book analytics should have been called with character "<name>" and source "characters-list"
        Examples:
            | position | name                          | book                                           | collection                         |

    Scenario: ListView 06 - Characters ListView: read status
        When the read status of the list of characters is status: unread
        And I scroll the list of characters to position 34
        Then the read status of the list of characters is status: read
#
#    Scenario: ListView 07 - Characters ListView: analytics action
#        When I click the button "next"
#        And I click the button "prev"
#        And I click the button "next"

  # Second ListView: categories: nested with three levels:
  # 1. Categories: vertical with fixed height.
  # 2. Books: books for each of the categories. Horizontal.
  # 3. Characters: characters for each book. Vertical, no-scroll.

#    Scenario: ListView 08 - Categories ListView (nested): categories
#        Then the list of categories should have height equal to 307
#        And the list of categories should be scrollable only vertically
#        And should render the list of categories with exactly 3 items in the vertical plane
#        And every element in the list of categories should have a unique id or no id at all
#
    Scenario Outline: ListView 09 - Categories ListView (nested): categories and number of books

#        And the book analytics should have been called with category "<category>" and source "categories-list"

        Then categories listView at <position> should show title <category>
        And categories listView should have a template with <id> at <position>
        And categories listView at <position> a books list with <booksListId> with exactly <numberOfBooks> items in the horizontal plane
        And books list with id <booksListId> should be scrollable only horizontally

        Examples:
            | position | category | numberOfBooks | id                 | booksListId           |

#
#    Scenario Outline: ListView 10 - Categories ListView (nested): books and their characters
#        Then should render "<title>" by "<author>" in "<category>" with the characters "<characters>"
#        And the parent container of the book "<title>", in "<category>", should have id "book:<categoryId>:<title>"
#        And the list of characters in "<title>" should be vertical
#        And the list of characters in "<title>" should not be scrollable
#        And each character text in "<title>" should have its id prefixed by "character:<category>:<title>:" and suffixed by its index
#        And the book analytics should have been called with book "<title>" and source "categories-books-list"
#        And for each character in [<characters>], the book analytics should have been called with the parameter "character" equal to its name and the parameter "source" equal to "categories-books-characters-list"
#
#        Examples:
