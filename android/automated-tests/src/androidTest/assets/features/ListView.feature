Feature: ListView Component Validation

    As a Beagle developer/user
    I'd like to make sure my listView component works as expected
    In order to guarantee that my application never fails

    Background:
        Given that I'm on the listView screen
#        And the view port size is 720x480

  # First ListView: characters: horizontal with pagination and custom iteratorName

    Scenario: ListView 01 - Characters ListView
        Then listView with id charactersList should have exactly 34 items
        And listView with id charactersList should be in horizontal orientation
        And screen should show text: 1/2

    Scenario: ListView 02 - Characters ListView: going from page 1 to 2
        When I click on button next
        Then listView with id charactersList should have exactly 33 items
        And listView with id charactersList should be in horizontal orientation
        And screen should show text: 2/2

    Scenario: ListView 03 - Characters ListView: going back from page 2 to 1
        When I click on button next
        And I click on button prev
        Then listView with id charactersList should have exactly 34 items
        And listView with id charactersList should be in horizontal orientation
        And screen should show text: 1/2

    Scenario Outline: ListView 04 - Characters ListView: page 1 item by item
        When I scroll listView with id charactersList to position <position>
        Then listView with id charactersList at position <position> should show text: <name>
        And listView with id charactersList at position <position> should show text: <book>
        And listView with id charactersList at position <position> should show text: <collection>

        Examples:
            | position | name                        | book                                           | collection                         |
