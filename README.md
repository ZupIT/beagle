## **About**
Beagle is an **open-source framework** for **cross-platform** development using the concept of Server-Driven UI.

This framework allows teams to build and alter layouts and data directly through a backend but yet displaying its contents natively in a mobile application and/or through a web one.

You can also create, test and update native application components and screen paths without updating the mobile application at the store (App Store or Play Store).
