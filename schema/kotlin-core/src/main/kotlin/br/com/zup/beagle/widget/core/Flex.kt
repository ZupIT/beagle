/**
 *
 * The flex is a Layout component that will handle your visual component positioning at the screen.
 * Internally Beagle uses a Layout engine called Yoga Layout to position elements on screen.
 * In fact it will use the HTML Flexbox properties applied on the visual components and its children.
 *
 * @param flexDirection
 *                          controls the direction in which the children of a node are laid out.
 *                          This is also referred to as the main axis
 * @param flexWrap
 *                  set on containers and controls what happens when children
 *                  overflow the size of the container along the main axis.
 * @param justifyContent align children within the main axis of their container.
 * @param alignItems Align items describes how to align children along the cross axis of their container.
 * @param alignSelf
 *                      Align self has the same options and effect as align items
 *                      but instead of affecting the children within a container.
 * @param alignContent Align content defines the distribution of lines along the cross-axis..
 * @param positionType The position type of an element defines how it is positioned within its parent.
 * @param basis is an axis-independent way of providing the default size of an item along the main axis.
 * @param flex TODO.
 * @param grow describes how any space within a container should be distributed among its children along the main axis.
 * @param shrink
 *              describes how to shrink children along the main axis in the case that
 *              the total size of the children overflow the size of the container on the main axis.
 * @param display enables a flex context for all its direct children.
 * @param size add size to current view applying the flex.
 * @param margin
 *                  effects the spacing around the outside of a node.
 *                  A node with margin will offset itself from the bounds of its parent
 *                  but also offset the location of any siblings.
 *                  The margin of a node contributes to the total size of its parent if the parent is auto sized.
 * @param padding
 *                  affects the size of the node it is applied to.
 *                  Padding in Yoga acts as if box-sizing: border-box; was set.
 *                  That is padding will not add to the total size of an element if it has an explicit size set.
 *                  For auto sized nodes padding will increase the size of the
 *                  node as well as offset the location of any children..
 * @param position add padding to position.
